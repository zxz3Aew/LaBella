<!-- You'll want files from vendors such as jQuery and Bootstrap to be included before yours. This means that:
    CSS: You can override their styles with your own*
    Scripts: You have access to any objects added to the global scope such as window (jQuery adds $, for example) -->

CSS Tip #1: Resetting Your Styles with CSS Reset by William Craig
<!--2. Your CSS Reset has to be the first thing the browser sees (duh).
Resetting your styles after declaring a style rule for an element will mess you up. You’ll scratch your head wonder

browser sees is your CSS Reset.

Laugh now, but it’s a common mistake amongst rusty veterans and beginning developers.

Note: In case you fall into the “people-prone-to-this-common-mistake” category, here’s the reason why it has to 
be at the very top of your CSS document/s: CSS works on a top-down hierarchy with rules lower down the CSS 
document taking precedence if there’s a conflicting/redundant style rule declaration.-->
